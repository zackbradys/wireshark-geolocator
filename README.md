# Wireshark Geolocator (Python)
Simple [Python](https://www.python.org/) program using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and [MaxMind's GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) to locate users via their internet protocol addresses.

## How Does It Work?
This is a [python](https://www.python.org/) program that uses [wireshark's](https://www.wireshark.org/) command line packet analyzer (aka [tshark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html)) to intercept users internet protocol addresses and determine their approximate location (IP Address are inherently imprecise). Once the connection has started, the IP Address will be determined by analzying your network traffic with [wireshark/tshark](https://www.wireshark.org/). Once the IP Address is determined, this script will use [MaxMind's GeoLite2 databases](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/), to find their IP Address location information such as their continent, country, state, city, and postal code (will be implementing latitude and longitude soon). Once their IP Address and Location information has been determined, it will print the result and automatically update.

## Why Do We Need This?
We do not necessarily need this program/script. It is fun, cool, and interesting tool that should only be used for educational and entertainment purposes only. Information gathered or obtained through this script is publicly accessible information and should not be used for any illegal or nefarious activities. I only provided this script to make it easier present and obtain this information and I am not responsible for any actions or activities taken as a result of this program/script. There are many programs/scripts like this on internet and I hope you do not use them maliciously.
